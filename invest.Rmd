# Idea

Many people do not accept that global are rising. While some of them are naïve, others are shrewd investors. I wondered what would happen if these folk tought about the temperature the way they think of investments.

The Sharpe Ratio is an important tool for judging a stock: $\frac{\mu}{\sigma}$

# Methodology

* Select stations at random

# Results

```{r}
station.index<-add.cartesian.coordinates(read.index())
ids<-random.station.ids(3,station.index)
ss<-subset(station.index[ids,],TRUE,c('ID','NAME','LATITUDE','LONGITUDE'))
kable(ss,row.names=FALSE)
```
